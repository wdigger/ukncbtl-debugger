# ukncbtl-debugger

A console (command-line) debugger for [UKNCBTL](https://github.com/nzeemin/ukncbtl), an emulator
of the Soviet UKNC (УКНЦ, Электроника МС 0511) educational computer. It links against UKNCBTL's
`emubase` emulation core directly, with no GUI dependency, so it builds and runs anywhere a C++17
compiler does — Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The command set is a console port of the table-driven command dispatcher from the WinAPI GUI
debugger, reworked for a plain stdin/stdout session, plus commands that only make sense in a
scriptable tool: save/load state, floppy image attach/detach, ROM cartridge attach/detach,
screenshot export, and screen OCR to text.

The UKNC has two PDP-11-style processors — a central processor (CPU) and a peripheral processor
(PPU). The debugger drives both; the `p` command switches which one the register/step/disasm
commands act on, and the prompt shows the current one (`CPU:` or `PPU:`).

## Why

The GUI debugger is great for interactive work, but it's Windows-only and not scriptable. This
tool exists for the cases where you want to:

- build and run the emulator in a CI pipeline, a container, or any non-Windows environment,
- drive a debugging or reverse-engineering session from a script (feed it commands over stdin,
  capture state, compare runs),
- automate things like "boot this disk image for N frames and read what's on screen" without a
  display — the `screentext` command OCRs the framebuffer back into text.
- debug by symbol name and source line instead of raw octal addresses — `symbols load` reads
  either an ELF executable, with its symbol table and its DWARF line table, or an ordinary GNU ld
  map file (`-Wl,-Map=out.map`). The program itself runs from a flat RT-11 SAV image that carries
  neither, so this is read out-of-band, from the file the linker produced on the way there.

## Building

Requires a C++17 compiler (GCC and Clang on Linux/macOS; MSVC/Visual Studio 2022 project files
are also included for Windows).

```sh
make            # release build (default) -> build/release/ukncbtldebug
make debug      # debug build -> build/debug/ukncbtldebug
make run        # build (release) and run
make run-debug  # build (debug) and run
make clean      # remove build artifacts
```

On Windows, open `ukncbtldebug.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.

### ROM file

The emulator boots from the UKNC system ROM, expected as `uknc_rom.bin` (32 KB) in the directory
you run the debugger from. If the file is missing or short, the debugger reports it and fails to
initialize rather than crashing.

## Running

```sh
./ukncbtldebug
```

On startup the debugger drops into a command prompt showing the current processor and its PC in
octal, e.g. `PPU:000000>`. Type `h` for the command list.

### Example: run for a while, then read the screen

```
$ ./ukncbtldebug
BKBTL emulator console debugger [...]
Use 'h' command to show help.
PPU:000000> disk1 attach rt11.dsk
Attached disk1: rt11.dsk
PPU:000000> cf400
 Stopped at 104134 (no breakpoint hit after 400 frames)
PPU:104134> i floppy
Floppy engine: ON
  disk1: attached, read-write
  disk2: not attached
  disk3: not attached
  disk4: not attached
PPU:104134> screentext
...recognized screen text...
PPU:104134> screen boot.png
Saved screenshot boot.png
```

## Commands

Single-letter commands never take a space before their argument (`d100260`, `r0=123`); full-word
commands always do (`disasm 100260`, `continue frames 10`). Numeric arguments are octal
throughout, **except** the frame count in `continue frames N`/`cfN`, which is decimal.

Commands that change state (registers, memory, breakpoints, reset, file/disk/cartridge
operations) print a short confirmation line. `disasm`/`d`/`D` and `memory`/`m` page their output:
after a page, the prompt becomes a `-- more --` prompt; pressing Enter shows the next page at the
same address/format/modifiers, and any other input cancels paging (that input is discarded, not
run as a command).

### General

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `h`, `help`, `?` | Show the command list |
| `q`, `quit`, `exit` | Quit the debugger |
| `reset` | Reset the machine |
| `p` | Switch the current processor between CPU and PPU |

### Execution control

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `c`, `continue` | Continue; free run |
| `cXXXXXX`, `continue XXXXXX` | Continue; run and stop at address `XXXXXX` |
| `cfN`, `continue frames N` | Continue; run for exactly `N` frames (decimal; 50 frames = 1 second) |
| `s`, `step` | Step Into; execute one instruction |
| `n`, `next` | Step Over; execute the current instruction and stop right after it |

### Registers

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `r`, `regs` | Show all registers and PSW flags |
| `r ext`, `regs ext` | Show extended (I/O port) registers |
| `rN` | Show register `N` (0-7) |
| `rN=XXXXXX` | Set register `N` to `XXXXXX` |
| `rps` / `rps=XXXXXX` | Show / set the processor status word |
| `rpc` / `rpc=XXXXXX` | Show / set PC |
| `rsp` / `rsp=XXXXXX` | Show / set SP |

Register commands act on whichever processor is current (`CPU`/`PPU`, toggled with `p`).

### Disassembly and memory

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `d`, `disasm` | Disassemble from PC (paged); use `D` for short format (no raw opcode words) |
| `dXXXXXX`, `disasm XXXXXX` | Disassemble from address `XXXXXX` |
| `m`, `memory` | Examine memory at PC (paged) |
| `mXXXXXX`, `memory XXXXXX` | Examine memory at address `XXXXXX` |
| `ms ADDR=VALUE`, `memset ADDR=VALUE` | Set the word at `ADDR` to `VALUE` |
| `ms ADDR=VALUE bytes` | Same, but writes one byte instead of a word |
| `... bytes` | Modifier: byte granularity instead of words |
| `... hex` | Modifier: hexadecimal instead of octal |
| `... nochars` | Modifier: hide the trailing ASCII/character column |

Modifiers go after the address, in any order, e.g. `m100260 bytes hex` or `memory hex nochars`.
Values that changed since the last step/run are highlighted (in a terminal that supports color;
suppressed automatically otherwise).

### Breakpoints

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `b` | List all breakpoints |
| `bXXXXXX` | Set a breakpoint at `XXXXXX` |
| `b NAME` | Set a breakpoint at symbol `NAME` (see `symbols load`) |
| `b FILE:LINE` | Set a breakpoint at a source line (needs an ELF built with `-g`) |
| `bc` | Remove all breakpoints |
| `bcXXXXXX` | Remove the breakpoint at `XXXXXX` |

Once symbols are loaded, every printed address (disassembly, `rpc`/`r`'s PC
column, breakpoint list, and the "Stopped at" message after `continue`) gets
a `<name>` or `<name+offset>` suffix for free — the nearest symbol at or
below that address, so an offset just means "no exact symbol there", not an
error. An ELF also gives each symbol's extent, so an address past the end of
the program gets no name at all rather than a large offset into the last one.

### Source lines

Loading an ELF built with `-g` also reads its DWARF line table, and then the
PC is reported as `file.c:42` alongside the symbol, breakpoints can be set on
a source line, and the source itself can be listed.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `list`, `l` | Show source around the PC, or carry on from the last listing |
| `list FILE:LINE` | Show source around that line |
| `list NAME` | Show source around function `NAME` |
| `files` | List the source files the line table names |
| `b FILE:LINE` | Break at a source line |
| `ss`, `sstep` | Step one source line, into calls that have source |
| `sn`, `snext` | Step one source line, running any call to completion |

Disassembly is interleaved with the source it came from:

```
g2.c:6    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
 001162 <sum+000014> MOV #000001, 177774(R5)
 001170 <sum+000022> BR 001204
g2.c:7      total += i;
 001172 <sum+000024> ADD 177774(R5), 177776(R5)
```

`ss` and `sn` single-step until the source line changes; `sn` additionally
ignores lines outside the function it started in, so a call runs to
completion instead of being stepped through. Neither can stop in a function
with no line information of its own, so both run library and operating
system calls to the end. Single-stepping does not advance the frame timer,
so code waiting on the 50 Hz interrupt or on a keypress will not make
progress; both commands give up after two million instructions and say so.

The line table is the compiler's own, so `b FILE:LINE` means "the first
instruction the compiler attributed to that line". A line that generated no
code of its own has no address; the breakpoint then goes to the next line
that did, and the command says which. With optimization on, a line's code
need not be contiguous or in source order.

`list` reads the source from where the compiler recorded it at build time,
which is only where it still is if the tree has not moved.

### Status and tracing

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `i`, `info` | Show uptime and floppy drive status |
| `i floppy`, `info floppy` | Show floppy engine state, per-drive attach status, and controller registers |
| `t`, `trace` | Toggle instruction tracing to `trace.log` on/off |
| `tXXXXXX`, `trace XXXXXX` | Set the trace flags explicitly (see `TRACE_xxx` in `emubase/Board.h`) |
| `tc`, `t clear`, `trace clear` | Clear `trace.log` |

### Profiling

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `prof on`, `prof off` | CPU tick profiler on/off; the profile keeps accumulating across runs while on |
| `prof reset` | Zero the profile |
| `prof`, `prof N` | Top 20 (or N) functions by CPU ticks, with their share of the total |
| `prof NAME` | Every instruction of function `NAME`, disassembled, with its ticks |
| `prof save FILE` | Dump the raw histogram: one `address ticks` line per non-zero address |

The core steps the CPU one clock tick per call, so every tick is charged to
the address of the instruction the CPU is executing at that moment: the
result is an exact cycle count per instruction, not a statistical sample.
Function names come from the loaded map (`symbols load`); ticks at addresses
below the nearest symbol are charged to that symbol, so library code with no
global symbol of its own shows up under whatever global precedes it, and
addresses outside the map (monitor, ROM) are grouped by 4K page. A usual
round is `prof reset`, `cf100`, `prof`. Profiling runs the same slower
execution path as breakpoints do.

### Keyboard

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `kd KEY`, `key down KEY` | Press and hold `KEY` |
| `ku KEY`, `key up KEY` | Release `KEY` |
| `k KEY`, `key KEY` | Click `KEY`: press, wait, release |
| `k MOD+KEY`, `key MOD+KEY` | Hold `MOD`, click `KEY`, release `MOD` |

`KEY`/`MOD` is a letter, digit, punctuation character, named key, or a raw octal scancode.
Named keys: `ENTER` `SPACE` `TAB` `BACKSPACE` `LEFT` `RIGHT` `UP` `DOWN`, the function keys
`K1`..`K5`, the editing/mode keys `POM` `UST` `ISP` `SBROS` `STOP` `AR2` `UPR` `ALF` `GRAF`
`FIKS` `SHIFT`, and the numeric keypad `NUM0`..`NUM9` `NUM+` `NUM-` `NUM,` `NUM.` `NUMENTER`.
Hold `AR2`/`UPR`/`ALF`/`GRAF`/`FIKS`/`SHIFT` as `MOD` in `key MOD+KEY`, e.g. `k SHIFT+A`.
Letters are named by the Latin glyph on the key. Scancodes match UKNCBTL's own
`emulator/KeyboardView.cpp`, so the same key works whether named or given as a raw octal code.

### Files, floppy images, and cartridges

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `memsave [FILE]` | Save a full memory dump (default `memdump.bin`) |
| `statesave FILE` / `stateload FILE` | Save / load full emulator state — memory, registers, ports |
| `symbols load FILE`, `sym load FILE` | Load symbols from an ELF executable (with its DWARF source lines, if built with `-g`) or from a GNU ld map file |
| `symbols`, `sym` | List the currently loaded symbol table |
| `list`, `l`, `list FILE:LINE`, `list NAME` | Show source (needs an ELF built with `-g`) |
| `files` | List the source files the line table names |
| `ss`, `sstep`, `sn`, `snext` | Step by source line, into or over calls |
| `diskN attach FILE`, `diskN a FILE` | Attach a floppy image to drive `N` (`1`-`4`) |
| `diskN detach`, `diskN d` | Detach the floppy image from drive `N` |
| `cartN attach FILE`, `cartN a FILE` | Attach a 24 KB ROM cartridge to slot `N` (`1`-`2`) |
| `cartN detach`, `cartN d` | Detach the ROM cartridge from slot `N` |
| `screen [FILE]` | Save a black-and-white screenshot as PNG (default filename: timestamp) |
| `screentext [FILE]` | OCR the screen to text; print to the console, or write it to `FILE` (UTF-8) |

`screentext` recognizes each 8×11 character cell against the machine's current and standard
fonts, translating the result through the UKNC KOI8-R character set to Unicode — so Latin,
Cyrillic, and the pseudographics all come out readable.

## Platform notes

- Console color output is automatically suppressed when stdout is not a terminal (redirected or
  piped), so scripted/batch use never sees raw escape codes.
- `TCHAR` is `char` on non-Windows builds; the Win32 `wmain`/wide-string code paths only compile
  under MSVC. Console output uses UTF-16 wide mode on Windows and a UTF-8 locale elsewhere.

## Status

This is a work in progress, developed interactively.
